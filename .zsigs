Dismissed as coincidence.
Fall into the nothingness that awaits you
undimmed, before the breaking of the world
All claudia return to exile
Last exile in the bottle
I feel the anger changing me
Music as a weapon
Mildew never sleeps, and neither do I.
I don't know, and neither do you
Too much violence is never enough.
Coloured balls on green wool.
If it were easy, everyone would do it.
Standing tall in your new cloak armor
Never surrender, never graduate
Perfect for disaffected middle school students
Witness the audacity of the pirate
